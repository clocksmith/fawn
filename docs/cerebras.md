# Doe ↔ Cerebras

Index for the Doppler → Doe → Cerebras lane: current status, source locations,
hardware runbook, bundle pointer, and claim scope.

[GOALS.md](../GOALS.md#strategic-constraints) selects work. This lane is not in
the current selection, which is Fawn's shared workspace service and DoeRuntime's
Doppler Node generation advantage over Dawn on Vulkan, then ONNX transfer. It
proceeds only under the
[accelerator admission rule](runtime-ownership-decision.md#cerebras-and-accelerator-retargeting);
the status and blockers linked here describe the lane, not selected work.

## Progress at a glance

```bash
python3 bench/tools/cerebras_status_snapshot.py
```

Writes `bench/out/r3-cerebras-status/snapshot.{json,md}`. The snapshot is a
per-lane verdict table built from receipts and carries the current counts.

Live narrative status: [`docs/status/cerebras-csl.md`](status/cerebras-csl.md).
Per-model evidence checklists with acceptance bars and active blocker queues:
[`cerebras-model-ledgers.md`](cerebras-model-ledgers.md).

## Source code

| Surface | Path |
|---|---|
| TSIR (semantic + planner + emitters) | `runtime/zig/src/compiler/tsir/` |
| CSL emit (classifier/template path) | `runtime/zig/src/compiler/wgsl/emit/csl/` |
| Hardware runners (Gemma/Qwen HostPlan + bounded cells) | `bench/runners/csl-runners/` |
| Bundle / verify / status tools | `bench/tools/cerebras_*`, `bench/tools/*evidence*`, `bench/tools/synthesize_*` |
| TSIR lowering contract | [`docs/tsir-contract.md`](tsir-contract.md) |
| CSL abstraction stack | [`docs/csl-architecture.md`](csl-architecture.md) |

## Reproduce

Use the operator runbook for exact commands:
[`docs/cerebras-hardware-runbook.md`](cerebras-hardware-runbook.md).

The status snapshot command above is intentionally the only command repeated in
this front door.

For local pre-hardware classification, refresh the snapshot and then run:

```bash
python3 bench/tools/check_cerebras_no_hardware_readiness.py
```

That gate checks that Qwen local evidence, local blockers, and the missing WSE
receipt are all typed. It is not a hardware execution claim.

## Run on hardware

Operator runbook: commands, hardware receipt paths, required receipt fields,
publication boundaries, and email text:
[`docs/cerebras-hardware-runbook.md`](cerebras-hardware-runbook.md).

Bundle pointer with archive sha256, pinned commit, regenerated timestamp, and
verification commands:
[`docs/cerebras-evidence-bundle-pointer.md`](cerebras-evidence-bundle-pointer.md).

Bundle source. The packer extracts archive-root files like `README.md`,
`CLAIM_SCOPE.md`, `MODEL_ACCESS.md`, `CEREBRAS_ASK.md`, and
`LOCAL_INSPECTION.md` from marked sections of this file:
[`docs/cerebras-evidence-bundle.md`](cerebras-evidence-bundle.md).

Governance + claim scope: [`docs/hardware-validation-appendix.md`](hardware-validation-appendix.md).

## Why

- Project rationale: [`docs/thesis.md`](thesis.md).
- Practitioner pain points: [`docs/problems-addressed.md`](problems-addressed.md).
- Model target rationale: dense Gemma plus hybrid Qwen, both on the Q4K → f16
  contract. See the public page copy and the per-model ledgers above.

## Scope notes

- Embedded pass totals. Run the snapshot.
- Roadmap timing. Status snapshot + evidence ledgers carry current state;
  blockers are named without estimates.
- Internal iteration jargon. Build-iteration vs parity-iteration discipline
  for the TSIR rewrite lives in [`docs/tsir-contract.md`](tsir-contract.md);
  it sits outside the Cerebras lane progress signal.
